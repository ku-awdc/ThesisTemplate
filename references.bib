abstract = {Random regression models (RRM) have become common for the analysis of longitudinal data or repeated records on individuals over time. Applications in animal breeding research are emphasized while recognizing that RRM are used in many biological situations including human health. The best known application of RRM has been to genetic evaluation of dairy cattle using test day production records. The basic structure of a RRM is given. Other applications include growth traits in all species, genotype by environment interactions, and ad hoc proposals for the analysis of survival data and fertility data. RRM allow the researcher to study changes in genetic variability with time and allow selection of individuals to alter the general patterns of response over time. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.
